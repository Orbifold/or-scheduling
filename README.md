# Scheduling Solution based on OR Tools

<img src="./schedule.png" style="width:800px"/>

This project is a scheduling solution based on OR Tools. It is a simple example of how to use OR Tools to solve a scheduling problem.
The use-case is similar to [the job shop problem (JSP)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Job-shop_scheduling) and is as follows:

- there are **locations** which have to be serviced by a team of workers. Each location has a type and a duration
- there are **workers** who have different **skills** and can work on different types of locations
- between servicing a location there is a variable **delay** 
- the schedule has to respect lunch breaks and the maximum working hours of the workers
- the objective function is to minimize the total time to service all locations.

üìò The book entitled ["A book on open shop scheduling"](https://www.amazon.com/Book-Open-Shop-Scheduling-International/dp/303091027X) by Wieslaw Kubiak provides a good introduction to the topic.

üê∫ You can also find [a simplified approach using Wolfram](https://discovery.graphsandnetworks.com/diverse/wolfram-scheduling.html) on Orbifold's Journal.

## Installation

You can use a conda environment or a virtual environment to install the dependencies.
Make sure you have [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/) installed.

```bash
poetry install
```
If you already have a venv present, you can use it with poetry:

```bash
python -m venv venv && source venv/bin/activate
poetry config virtualenvs.in-project true
poetry install
```
## Testing

You can run the tests with the following command:

```bash
poetry run pytest
```
The tests are located in the `tests` folder and they also explain the use-case.

## Visualization

The Gantt-like viz based on Matplotlib is of interest on its own. That is, it's somewhat tricky to assemble it from scratch. There are very good packages out there doing a much better job but this one is easier to adapt.
